# Titanic Prediction with XGBoost
## Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the Titanic dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and subsequently building a predictive model using the XGBoost algorithm. The objective is to gain insights into the dataset and create a robust model for predicting survival outcomes on the Titanic.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Data Exploration:
Gain an understanding of the dataset's structure, features, and data types.
Investigate missing values, outliers, and potential data anomalies.

### Visualizations:
Utilize visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar plots, correlation matrices) to unveil patterns and relationships within the dataset.
Explore the distribution of variables and their impact on survival.

## XGBoost Prediction Model
### Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the dataset for modeling.

### Feature Engineering:
Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.

### Model Building:
Implement the XGBoost algorithm for classification.
Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

### Evaluation:
Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the ROC curve.
